This is modular_resolution, version 1.1

modular_resolution is a sub-package of p_group_cohomology and is a set of programs
and a C-library to compute presentations and minimal free resolutions of modular
group algebras of prime power groups.

The original version of the code was written by David J. Green, using meataxe-2.2.3.
Simon A. King has refactored the code to use meataxe-2.4.24 instead, and use
autotools.

See INSTALL for installing modular_resolution-1.1.

The package comprises a shared library "libmodres", as well as the executables
makeActionMatrices, makeNontips, perm2Gap, groupInfo, and makeInclusionMatrix.
